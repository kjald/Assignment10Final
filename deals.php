<b>Consignments are limited to 10 items per day, clean, pressed and on hangers and folded. No rips, tears, missing buttons, missing tags, stains, pet hair, strong perfumes. Because I have lots of inventory, I am not taking any consignments Sunday - Wednesday.  Please call ahead before any pick up of money or unsold clothing.  Store credit may be used at any time.  Donations will be made after the 90 day deadline passes to Dress for Success, Women Helping Battered Women or Burl Emergency Shelter.  There is a drop bin inside if you want to drop off any donated clothes.</b>
